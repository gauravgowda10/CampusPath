# Tests that a graph, a pair of nodes, an edge between them,
# a pair of nodes and a single edge can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph pairNodes

# Add a pair of nodes
added node x to pairNodes
added node y to pairNodes
added node z to pairNodes
added node u to pairNodes

# Add edges
added edge 1 from x to y in pairNodes
added edge 2 from y to x in pairNodes
added edge 3 from x to u in pairNodes
added edge 4 from x to z in pairNodes

# Print the nodes in the graph
pairNodes contains: u x y z
the children of x in pairNodes are: u(3) y(1) z(4)
the children of y in pairNodes are: x(2)
the children of z in pairNodes are:
the children of u in pairNodes are:
