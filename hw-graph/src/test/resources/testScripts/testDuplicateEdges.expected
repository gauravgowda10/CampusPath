# Tests that adding the same edges multiple times

# Create graph
created graph duplicateEdges

# Add nodes to duplicateEdges
added node x to duplicateEdges
added node y to duplicateEdges

# Add edges to duplicateEdges
added edge sameXX from x to x in duplicateEdges
added edge sameYY from y to y in duplicateEdges
added edge diffXY1 from x to y in duplicateEdges

# Add Duplicate edges to duplicateEdges
added edge sameXX from x to x in duplicateEdges
added edge sameYY from y to y in duplicateEdges
added edge diffXY1 from x to y in duplicateEdges

# List nodes and the outgoing edges
duplicateEdges contains: x y
the children of x in duplicateEdges are: x(sameXX) y(diffXY1)
the children of y in duplicateEdges are: y(sameYY)
