# Tests adding two nodes and two edges

# Create a graph
created graph twoNodeGraph

# Add two nodes
added node x to twoNodeGraph
added node y to twoNodeGraph

# Add two edges
added edge XX from x to x in twoNodeGraph
added edge XY from x to y in twoNodeGraph

# Print the nodes in the graph
twoNodeGraph contains: x y
the children of x in twoNodeGraph are: x(XX) y(XY)
the children of y in twoNodeGraph are:
