# Tests adding two nodes and six edges to graph

# Create a graph
created graph multiEdgesGraph

# Add two nodes
added node x to multiEdgesGraph
added node y to multiEdgesGraph

# Add six edges
added edge sameXX from x to x in multiEdgesGraph
added edge sameYY from y to y in multiEdgesGraph
added edge diffXY1 from x to y in multiEdgesGraph
added edge diffXY2 from x to y in multiEdgesGraph
added edge diffYX1 from y to x in multiEdgesGraph
added edge diffYX2 from y to x in multiEdgesGraph

# Print the nodes and edges in the graph
multiEdgesGraph contains: x y
the children of x in multiEdgesGraph are: x(sameXX) y(diffXY1) y(diffXY2)
the children of y in multiEdgesGraph are: x(diffYX1) x(diffYX2) y(sameYY)
